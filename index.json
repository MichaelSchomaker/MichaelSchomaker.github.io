The problem with this approach is that (i) regression parameters after model selection are often biased and (ii) the respective standard errors are too small because they do not reflect the uncertainty related to the model selection process. It has been proposed that the drawback of model selection can be overcome by model averaging. With model averaging, one calculates a weighted average $\\hat{\\bar{\\beta}} = \\sum_{\\kappa=1}^{k} w_{\\kappa} \\hat{\\beta}_{\\kappa}$ from $k$ parameter estimates of a set of candidate (regression) models $\\mathcal{M}={M_1,\\ldots,M_k}$, where the weights are calculated in a way such that better models receive a higher weight.\nA popular weight choice would be based on the exponential AIC,\n\\begin{eqnarray} w_{\\kappa}^{\\text{AIC}} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\frac{\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{AIC_{\\kappa})}}{\\sum_{\\kappa=1}^k\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{AIC_{\\kappa})}} , \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\mathrm{AIC_{\\kappa}}$ is the AIC value related to model $M_{\\kappa}\\in\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\sum_{\\kappa} w_{\\kappa}^{\\text{AIC}} =1$. It has been suggested to estimate the variance of the scalar $\\hat{\\bar{\\beta}}_j \\in \\hat{\\bar{{\\beta}}}$ via\n\\begin{eqnarray} \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\bar{\\beta}}j) \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; {\\sum{\\kappa=1}^k w_{\\kappa} \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}{j,\\kappa}|M{\\kappa}) + (\\hat{\\beta}_{j,\\kappa}-\\hat{\\bar{\\beta}}_j})^2}^2 , \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $\\hat{\\beta}_{j,\\kappa}$ is the j$^{th}$ regression coefficient of the $\\kappa^{th}$ candidate model. This approach tackles problem (ii), the incorporation of model selection uncertainty into the standard errors of the regression parameters; but it may not necessarily tackle problem (i) as the regression parameters may still be biased. There are multiple different suggestions on how the weights can be calculated, and those implemented in \u0026ldquo;MAMI\u0026rdquo; are explained in the manual. Note that model selection can be viewed as a special case of model averaging where the ``best'' model receives weight $1$ (and all others a weight of $0$). All implemented model selection options are listed in the manual too.\nMultiple Imputation Multiple imputation (MI) is a popular method to address missing data. Based on assumptions about the data distribution (and the mechanism which gives rise to the missing data) missing values can be imputed by means of draws from the posterior predictive distribution of the unobserved data given the observed data. This procedure is repeated to create $M$ imputed data sets, the (regression) analysis is then conducted on each of these data sets and the $M$ results ($M$ point and $M$ variance estimates) are combined by a set of simple rules:\n\\begin{eqnarray} \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{MI}} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^M \\hat{\\beta}^{(m)} \\end{eqnarray}\nand \\begin{eqnarray} \\widehat{{\\text{Cov}}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{MI}}) \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\widehat{\\text{Cov}}(\\hat{\\beta}^{(m)}) + \\frac{M+1}{M(M-1)} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} (\\hat{\\beta}^{(m)}-\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{MI}}) (\\hat{\\beta}^{(m)}-\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{MI}})^{'} \\end{eqnarray}\nwhere $ \\hat{\\beta}^{(m)}$ refers to the estimate of $\\beta$ in the $\\text{m}^{th}$ imputed set of data. Confidence intervals are based on a particular $t$-distribution.\nModel Averaging (or Model Selection) after Multiple Imputation How can model averaging and model selection be applied to multiply imputed data? The detailed motivation can be found in the 2014 reference below. The basic results for model averaging are \\begin{eqnarray} \\hat{\\bar{\\beta}}_{\\text{MI}} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\hat{\\bar{\\beta}}^{(m)}\\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\hat{\\bar{{\\beta}}}^{(m)} = \\sum_{\\kappa=1}^{k} w_{\\kappa}^{(m)} \\hat{{\\beta}}_{\\kappa}^{(m)} \\end{eqnarray} and applies to any weight choice. If the variance of the model averaging estimator is estimated via the formula given above, the overall variance of the estimator after multiple imputation relates to \\begin{eqnarray} \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\bar{\\beta}}_{j,\\text{MI}}) \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} {\\sum_{\\kappa=1}^k w_{\\kappa} \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_{j,\\kappa}^{(m)})+(\\hat{\\beta}_{j,\\kappa}^{(m)}-\\hat{\\bar{\\beta}}_j^{(m)})^2} }^2 + \\newline \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\\frac{M+1}{M(M-1)} \\sum_{m=1}^{M} (\\hat{\\bar\\beta}_j^{(m)}-\\hat{\\bar\\beta}_{j,\\text{MI}})^2 . \\end{eqnarray} Confidence intervals could then again be estimated based on a $t$ distribution (as explained above) or, alternatively, via bootsrapping (see 2014 reference below, and this publication of mine for a general Bootstrap-MI framework).\nModel selection after imputation works essentially the same, except that parameters associated with variables which have not been selected are assumed to be $0$. With this assumption, a variable will be formally selected if it is selected in at least one imputed set of data, but its overall impact will depend on how often it is chosen. Here, confidence intervals will almost always be too narrow if the formula from above will be applied (because of model selection uncertainty) and bootstrapping is strongly recommended.\nAs a consequence for model selection (and model averaging), effects of variables which are not supported throughout imputed data sets (and candidate models) will simply be less pronounced.\n\nSoftware MAMI estimates the point estimates as explained above, together with confidence intervals that are either based on the formula above, or a Bayesian variation thereof, or bootstrapping (preferred option).\nIn addition, a variable importance measure (averaged over the $M$ imputed data sets) will be calculated: this measure simply sums up the weights $w_{\\kappa}$ of those candidate models $M_{\\kappa}$ that contain the relevant variable, and lies between $0$ (unimportant) and $1$ (very important). It is similar to the Bayesian posterior effect probability. Results can be interpreted and reported as suggested in the manual.\nMAMI\u0026rsquo;s main function is mami(). It is recommended to get familiar with the function\u0026rsquo;s syntax by typing ?mami, running the examples at the bottom of the help page and read through the manual.\n The package can be downloaded here. Install it via  install.packages(\u0026quot;MAMI\u0026quot;, repos=c(\u0026quot;http://R-Forge.R-project.org\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;http://cran.at.r-project.org\u0026quot;),\rdependencies=TRUE)\r  The manual can be found here. The package provides access to less frequently used model averaging techniques, offers integrated bootstrap estimation and easy-to-use parallelization. Optimal model averaging procedures are implemented too, and wrappers for their use in super learning are integrated into the package. See also here.  \nFurther considerations Interpretation of regression parameters requires care: for any explanatory interpretation causal considerations need to be taken into account (see my paper on regression and causailty here ). However, both model averaging and post model selection estimators are biased; thus, in most cases a causal interpretations are invalid. Even when confidence interval coverage is improved, as explained above, it does not change the fact that in many cases model averaging and model selection estimators are more suitable for predictive tasks. Modern doubly robust etimators, such as targeted maximum likelihood estimators, can integrate data-adaptive approaches which are based on predictive considerations, while still retaining valid inference. Therefore, the integration of model averaging estimators in machine learning approaches which are used for causal effect estimation can be attractive as explained in this recent paper of mine. MAMI offers a couple of wrappers that can be used to integrate different model averaging approaches into super learning, a data-adaptive approach which uses a weighted combination of different learning algorithms and is popular in causal inference. See Section 6.3. of the manual.\n\n","date":1593043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593043200,"objectID":"dd049d6448c475973eb34a4088041673","permalink":"https://MichaelSchomaker.github.io/project/mami/","publishdate":"2020-06-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mami/","section":"project","summary":"Model Averaging after Multiple Imputation","tags":["software"],"title":"MAMI","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"CICI is a new  package.

This is because the selected model is conditional on the selection process; a different dataset, or a different selection method, may yield different conclusions.\nFor many shrinkage estimators, the choice of one or many tuning parameters is required. Again, inference is conditional on the chosen tuning parameter. With model averaging, different \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; models are combined and the idea of shrinkage averaging estimation is to combine estimates resulting from different tuning parameter choices. Based on ideas from the optimal model averaging literature, one can think of clever combinations such that a cross-validation error is minimized. My 2012 paper explains the basic idea (see here), but our 2019 paper contains (see here) some more mature thoughts. These ideas are implemented in both my SAE package as well as the lae() function contained in my MAMI package (see here). More details are given below.\nLASSO averaging estimation Consider the LASSO estimator for a simple linear model: \\begin{eqnarray} \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{LE}}({\\lambda}) \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\text{arg} \\min {\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\beta_0 - \\sum_{j=1}^p x_{ij}{{\\beta}}_j)^2 + {\\lambda} \\sum_{j=1}^p |\\beta_j| },. \\end{eqnarray} The complexity parameter $\\lambda \\geq 0$ tunes the amount of shrinkage and is typically estimated via the generalized cross validation criterion (GCV) or any other cross validation criterion (CV). The larger the value of $\\lambda$, the greater the amount of shrinkage since the estimated coefficients are shrunk towards zero.\nConsider a sequence of candidate tuning parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}={\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_L}$. If each estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{LE}}({\\lambda_i})$ obtains a specific weight $w_{\\lambda_i}$, then a LASSO averaging estimator takes the form \\begin{eqnarray} \\hat{\\bar{\\beta}}_{\\text{LAE}}\u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\sum_{i=1}^L w_{\\lambda_i} \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{LE}}({\\lambda_i}) = \\mathbf{w}_\\lambda \\hat{\\boldsymbol{B}}_{\\text{LE}} , \\end{eqnarray} where $\\lambda_i \\in [0,c]$, $c\u0026gt;0$ is a suitable constant, $\\hat{{\\boldsymbol{B}}}_{\\text{LE}}=(\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{LE}}(\\lambda_1),\\ldots,\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{LE}}(\\lambda_L))'$ is the $L \\times p$ matrix of the LASSO estimators, $\\mathbf{w}_\\lambda=(w_{\\lambda_1},\\ldots,w_{\\lambda_L})$ is an $1 \\times L$ weight vector, $\\mathbf{w}_\\lambda \\in \\mathcal{W}$ and $\\mathcal{W}={\\mathbf{w}_\\lambda \\in [0,1]^L: \\mathbf{1}'\\mathbf{w}_\\lambda=1}$.\nOne could choose the weights \\begin{eqnarray} \\hat{\\mathbf{w}}_\\lambda^{\\text{OCV}} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\text{arg} \\min_{_{_{\\mathbf{w}_\\lambda\\in\\mathcal{W}}}} OCV_k \\end{eqnarray} with \\begin{eqnarray} OCV_k \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\frac{1}{n}{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon}_\\kappa(w)}' \\tilde{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon}_\\kappa(w) \\nonumber\\ \u0026amp;\\propto\u0026amp; \\mathbf{w}_{\\lambda} \\mathbf{E}'_k \\mathbf{E}_k {\\mathbf{w}_{\\lambda}}' ,, \\end{eqnarray} referring to an optimal cross validation (OCV) based criterion and $\\mathbf{E}_k = (\\tilde{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon}_k(\\lambda_1),\\ldots,\\tilde{\\boldsymbol\\epsilon}_k(\\lambda_L))$ is the $n \\times L$ matrix of the ($k$-fold) cross-validation residuals for the $L$ competing tuning parameters (given a specific loss function). An optimal weight vector for this criterion is then \\begin{eqnarray} w^{\\text{LAE}} \u0026amp;=\u0026amp; \\text{arg} \\min_{_{_{w\\in\\mathcal{W}}}} OCV_k . \\end{eqnarray} These weights can be calculated with quadratic programming.\nAlternatively, the weight choice may not be based on predictive purposes, but on confidence interval coverage and resampling may be an option in this case.\n\nSoftware Two implementations are available:\n the original files from 2012, summarized in the  SAE - package , available here. a broader and more efficient implementation in the function lae() in the MAMI package.  Briefly, the new implementation is better and faster and can be used for the linear model, the logistic model and the Poisson model \u0026ndash; but not for longitudinal or survival data. It can be used for Ridge, Elastic Net and Lasso. The original SAE package can only be used for the linear model, but has both the bootstrap weight choice and Random Lasso option implemented (but not the Elastic Net). The use of the new files are encouraged, but the old files may be useful for reproduction of results. There are many more options and possibilities, see Section 3.1.3 in the MAMI manual, or under ?sae in the SAE package.\n\nFurther considerations LASSO averaging is computationally very efficient. It is thus a fast prediction algorithm and suitable for inclusion into super learning. Super learning means considering a set of prediction algorithms, for example regression models, shrinkage estimators or regression trees. Instead of choosing the algorithm with the smallest cross validation error, super learning chooses a weighted combination of different algorithms, that is the weighted combination which minimizes the cross validation error. It can be shown that this weighted combination will perform at least as good as the best algorithm, if not better.\nBriefly, MAMI contains several shrinkage averaging estimation wrappers that can be used for super learning. They are listed and explained when typing\nlistSLWrappers()\r This is useful for both pure prediction problems and causal inference with targeted maximum likelihood estimation. The below 2019 reference (\u0026ldquo;When and when not to us eoptimal model avergaing\u0026rdquo;) contains more details.\n","date":1561593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561593600,"objectID":"8a6a59c7a15c847077077f16d85c82b0","permalink":"https://MichaelSchomaker.github.io/project/sae/","publishdate":"2019-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sae/","section":"project","summary":"Shrinkage Averaging Estimation","tags":["software"],"title":"SAE","type":"project"},{"authors":["M.

Whether it is feasible and whether there are benefits of working with a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and a non-parametric structural equation framework, is one aspect of the debate. A summary on this discussion can be found in a working paper by Imbens (see here).\nIn our paper, we are interested in a controversial macroeconomic question: does an independent central bank (CBI) reduce a country\u0026rsquo;s inflation? This question is causal in nature and certainly requires a causal inference approach to be answered. We have made the effort to develop an elaborate DAG for this question based on economic theory and substantiated it with literature as much as possible. Our suggestion is to commit to this causal model (i.e. the DAG), motivate it in much detail, discuss possible violations of it, and ultimately conduct sensitivity analyses that evaluate effect estimates under different (structural) assumptions.\nIn our analayses, we use the i) identifiability considerations from the derived DAG and ii) longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (LTMLE), a doubly robust estimation technique, in conjunction with data-adaptive estimation approaches (\u0026ldquo;super learning\u0026rdquo;) to derive our effect estimates. The advantage of using such an approach is that with LTMLE data-adaptive estimation can be used while still retaining valid inference (under assumptions). This reduces the risk of model mis-specification compared to estimation techniques which require the commitment to parametric assumptions, such as inverse probability of treatment weighting.\nWhile certainly challenging, our paper shows that even for complex macroeconomic questions, it is possible to develop a causal model and implement modern doubly robust longitudinal effect estimators. As with many questions in economics and the social sciences, one has to consider the possibility that some structural assumptions are incorrect. In our paper, we use both a purely data-adaptive approach as well as an approach motivated by economic theory to evaluate whether different, but meaningful, structural assumptions would lead to different estimates. Our main analysis (based on the developed DAG) suggests that if a country had legislated CBI for every year between 1998 and 2008, it would have had an average increase in inflation of 0.01 (95% confidence interval (CI): -1.48; 1.50) percentage points in 2010. The other two approaches, both of which make less structural assumptions, led to slightly different results: -0.44 (95% CI: -2.38; 1.59) and 0.01 (95% CI: -1.46; 1.47).\nFrom a monetary policy point of view, we could thus conclude that there is no strong support for the hypothesis that an independent central bank necessarily lowers inflation.\nIn summary: causal inference in economics, using directed acyclic graphs and modern doubly robust estimation strategies is challenging, but possible and certainly rewarding!\n","date":1625443200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1625443200,"objectID":"3c6877926574455f5926ce97d8d55551","permalink":"https://MichaelSchomaker.github.io/publication/2021-03-01_estimating_the_effect/","publishdate":"2021-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-03-01_estimating_the_effect/","section":"publication","summary":"Recently, there has been a lot of interest and discussion about the use of causal inference in economics.

Based on my co-author\u0026rsquo;s experience at the burns unit at Red Cross children\u0026rsquo;s hospital, we had the hypothesis that this may have caused an increase in pediatric hospital admissions. After collecting publicly available data from Twitter and Facebook, establishing co-operations with the city of Cape Town, acquiring weather data, developing a directed acyclic graph and under the consideration of various statistical angles, we concluded that load shedding (i.e. the temporary power shutdowns) did indeed increase the number of hospital admissions (by 10%; 95% confidence interval: 4%-15%).\nWhat I like about this study is that it shows how to creatively answer questions when it is difficult to obtain data; in our case from ESKOM, the national monopoly power supplier. And how to integrate causal thinking routinely into data analysis: co-operations and discussion on various levels helped us to derive a well thought through DAG, to gain confidence into our results and interpretations. There are many interesting angles in the supplementary material: for example the use causal inference in time series, the usefulness of model averaging when deciding for time trends, and a lot of clinical and spatial nuances not covered in the main text.\nThose who are interested in the paper, may favour to watch the video abstract before jumping to the pdf\u0026hellip;\n  ","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"18d38a498a2159b3b5a03bd49569c766","permalink":"https://MichaelSchomaker.github.io/publication/2018-01-01_the_effect_of_electr/","publishdate":"2018-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-01-01_the_effect_of_electr/","section":"publication","summary":"The Republic of South Africa (SA) faced repeated episodes of temporary power shutdowns in 2014/2015, but also in the years thereafter.

Schomaker","C. Heumann"],"categories":null,"content":"For many analyses, it is common to use both bootstrapping and multiple imputation (MI): MI to address missing data and bootstrapping to obtain standard errors. For example, when using the g-formula in causal inference, bootstrapping is required to obtain standard errors; however, the data may be multiply imputed due to missing (baseline) data in the population of interest. How should bootstrapping and multiple imputation then be combined? First bootstrapping ($B$ times, including missing data) and then impute ($M$ times); or first impute and then bootstrap the multiply imputed data? For the latter approach, one could use bootstrapping to estimate the standard error in each imputed data set and apply the standard MI combining rules (\u0026ldquo;Rubin\u0026rsquo;s rules\u0026rdquo;); alternatively, the $B \\times M$ estimates could be pooled and 95% confidence intervals could be calculated based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the respective empirical distribution. For the former approach, either multiple imputation combining rules can be applied to the imputed data of each bootstrap sample to obtain $B$ point estimates, which in turn, may be used to construct confidence intervals, or the $B \\times M$ estimates of the pooled data are used for interval estimation.\nIn our paper, we evaluated the above four approaches and found that three are generally valid whereas one - first imputing, then bootstrapping, and then pooling the estimates - is invalid. We describe the advantages, disadvantages and implications of all approaches and give guidance which approach may be suitable in which context. Under the code tag above, an example on how to implement the four respective approaches is contained as well as code of the simulation studies from the paper.\nWhat is nice about this manuscript is not only that it provides practical guidance, but also that it sparked some other interesting research. For instance, Bartlett and Hughes consider the combination of imputation and bootstrapping when imputation and analysis models are uncongenial or misspecified (see here). Interestingly, they find that bootstrapping, followed by imputation, and not pooling estimates, is the preferred approach in this case. This is in line with our suggested approach on model selection and averaging with multiply imputed data (see here). Also, van Hippel and Bartlett proposed an alternative, computationally efficient, point estimator and confidence interval when bootstraping followed by MI, which is implemented in an R-package ( bootImpute ).\nIt is nice to see this work being used and further developed; also after this manuscript got initially rejected by an applied stats journal because a reviewer insisted: \u0026ldquo;There is nothing really new in the paper\u0026rdquo;.\n","date":1523836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1523836800,"objectID":"2667e38ab34d12fe4f53199d7c501abc","permalink":"https://MichaelSchomaker.github.io/publication/2018-01-01_bootstrap_inference_/","publishdate":"2018-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-01-01_bootstrap_inference_/","section":"publication","summary":"For many analyses, it is common to use both bootstrapping and multiple imputation (MI): MI to address missing data and bootstrapping to obtain standard errors.
